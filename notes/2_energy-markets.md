## Section 2: Australia's energy markets

In the 1990s, Australian governments embarked on a series of energy market reforms designed to enhance competition, improve efficiency and driven innovation. In 1998, these reforms culminated in the establishment of the __National Electricity Market (NEM)__, creating a wholesale spot market spanning across participating eastern and southern states.

### Overview of Australia's electricity grids
Australia has several independent electricity grids.

### Overview of the National Electricity Market (NEM)

The NEM is a wholesale electricity market serving New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmanian and the Australian Capital Territory. The NEM facilities the buying and selling of electricity in real time across ~40,000 km of high-voltage tranmission lines to deliver ~180-200 TWh of electricity each year to a population of more than 24 million. There are more than 600 registered participants in the NEM, including generators, transmission and distribution network service providers, and market customers (including retailers and large commercial and industrial users).[^3]




### Roles and responsibilities in the NEM

#### [Legal] [^1]
The legal frameworks underpinning electricity generation, transmission and supply are largely within the constitutional responsbilitiy of the states, but in practice are exercised in a harmonised way. 

In the absence of express Commonwealth constitutional authority to legislate directly with respect to energy, the construct called the National Electricity Market (NEM) and its state law regulatory structure called the National Electricity Law (NEL) and the National Electricity Rules (NER), relies on and operates under the auspice of national competition law (the forerunner of the NER was the ACCC National Energy Code) and upon a founding bedrock of intergovernmental agreement.

The NEM was constituted on the basis of cooperative intergovernmental arrangements, the framework of which was established in 1996.[^2] The reforms brought into existence legislated structures and statutory institutional functionaries distinct and deconstructed from direct Government and/or Ministerial ‘control’. They are the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) responsible for NER rule changes; and the Australian Energy Market Regulator (AER) responsible largely for economic network regulation; and the Australian Energy Market Operator
(AEMO) a company limited by Guarantee and not a statutory entity. The distinct roles of each was constituted by legislative arrangements made under the auspice of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG now National Cabinet).

#### Statutory bodies
Three statutory market bodies govern the NEM:

|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) | Developing and making the NER and NERR.                                          |
| Australian Energy Regulator (AER)          | Economic regulation, rules compliance and monitoring the market.                 |
| Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO)   | Electricity and gas systems market operating, and national transmission planner. |

[^2]: The South Australian Parliament enacted the National Electricity (South Australia) Act 1996, Schedule 1 of which contains the National Electricity Law (NEL) which provides for the making of delegated legislation called the National Electricity Rules (NER). The NEL and NER apply as laws of each adoptive and participating State and Territory; South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and ACT. The NT and Western Australian systems are not part of the NEM and operate under different regulatory schemes. In Victoria the relevant adoptive law is the National Electricity (Victoria) Act 2005 (NEVA) and in and New South Wales is the National Electricity (New South Wales) Act 1997 (NENA).
