#### Investment in generation has been uneven and largely driven by specific policy measures
Investment in new generation in the NEM has fluctuated significantly over time, both in scale and by technology type. These shifts can be broadly grouped into three distinct periods since the market’s inception: a phase of growth driven primarily by rising peak demand (1998–2011); a period of oversupply and limited new investment outside of renewables mandated by the expanded Renewable Energy Target (RET) (2011–15); and the current phase of transition towards a low-emissions system (2015-present) (see Figure 20).

Although the design of the NEM aimed to let market forces drive investment decisions, government policy support has been a significant driver of investment in new generation since its inception. The Panel notes that this has been a feature of most deregulated electricity markets, irrespective of the market design adopted. Almost all investment in new generation capacity in the NEM has received some form of government policy support, and there are very few examples of pure, market-only investments that were made entirely on the basis of expectations about future spot market revenues and forward derivatives markets. Emerging research suggests NEM spot prices and derivative markets on their own have not driven recent investment decisions in the NEM, in contrast to the strong role of policy support.8
